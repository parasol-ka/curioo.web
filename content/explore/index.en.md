They also allow you to complete 📜 <b>quests</b> and earn <b>rewards</b>. The more quests you complete, the higher your level and rewards will be!

- 🐾 <b>CuriooCoins:</b><br/>
Use them to buy unique in-game items, spend them in the Guide’s local shop, or upgrade your cards!

- 📜 <b>Quests:</b><br/>
There are many 📜 <b>quests</b> to complete. Some are easy, others are more challenging. For example, there are quests to open 🧰 chests, travel certain distances, or collect specific types of 🎴 cards.
The most common one is the daily 🧰 chest, which appears once a day and allows you to discover a new 🎴 card.

   The most important 📜 <b>quest</b> is to <b>upgrade</b> 🔀 your 🎴 cards. When you own a card and are at its location, you can 🔀 <b>transform</b> it.

<div style="color:#f39c12; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
   💡 Example:<br>
   You own the Place Stanislas card and travel to the coordinates shown on the 🎴 card.<br/>
   You can then make this card golden for <b>10 CuriooCoins</b> to prove to everyone that you have been there!<br/>
   If you do not own the 🎴 card, you will need to pay <b>40 CuriooCoins</b>!

- **🎴 Guide Cards:**<br>
Look for **🎰 Golden Machines** in 🌀 portals to obtain **🎴 Guide Cards** that are already golden for <b>10 CuriooCoins</b>.
